# reMarkable Qt Sandbox

Welcome to my reMarkable Qt Sandbox where I upload all sorts of experimental applications to
practice qt programming for remarkable custom applications.

All directories found under this repository are essentially projects, that are not serious enough
to be pushed to our reHackable organisation.

To run these applications, the user is expected to have Qt Creator configured to deploy and run
Qt applications on the reMarkable tablet. If this is not the case, please reffer to [this article](http://remarkablewiki.com/index.php?title=Setting_up_Qt_Creator) which briefly explains how to configure Qt Creator for your device.
